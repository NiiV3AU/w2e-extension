# w2e - Watch To Embed
- Convert YouTube URLs from "/watch?v=xxx" to "/embed/xxx". 
# **"Why"** you ask?
- The reason being is that the new **adblock popup on yt is hella annoying** and with just changing "watch" with "embed" in the video-url its **gone**!
# How to get it to work (for the moment)
- install .zip > extract to a folder (all files in one folder) > open firefox > open: "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" > load temporary add-on > manifest.json (file is in the extracted folder) > Done
- needs to be done on every firefox-startup
